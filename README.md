# open-with-native-app
Opens link with possible native app/browser.

**Why I made this app?**  
I hate tech giants so I am trying to reduce dependence on them as much as possible. That includes not using the built-in browser of Facebook Messenger. Guess what? I can open all links in external browser except facebook.com links. Clicking does absolutely nothing. And this happens only when "Open links in external browser" is on. I have updated the apps few times and it didn't fix it. I don't want to update any further because of the huge UI changes they bring to the app without any notice.

So, this app kinda solves my problem, because I can always copy links and click the share button in the clipboard popup, from there I can select this app and the link will be opened in native FB app.

This is something I made for my personal use. So I don't care what you do with the app or code. Have a good day.
